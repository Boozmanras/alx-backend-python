# Python Async Comprehension Project

This project explores asynchronous comprehensions and generators in Python. It consists of three tasks that demonstrate various aspects of async programming.

## Requirements

* Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
* Python 3.7
* pycodestyle 2.5.x

## Files

1. `0-async_generator.py`: Contains an async generator that yields random numbers.
2. `1-async_comprehension.py`: Demonstrates async comprehensions using the generator from task 0.
3. `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measures the runtime of parallel async comprehensions.

## Tasks

### 0. Async Generator

Implement an async generator that yields random numbers.

### 1. Async Comprehensions

Use async comprehensions to collect random numbers from the async generator.

### 2. Run time for four parallel comprehensions

Measure the runtime of parallel async comprehensions.

## Usage

Each file can be run independently. For example:

```bash
./0-main.py
./1-main.py
./2-main.py
```
